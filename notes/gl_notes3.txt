Vertex Buffer Objects

  Usually a vertex buffer object is simply an array of data.
  Often floats for vertex information.

  VBOs give us the power to copy entire chunks of data to the gpu, instead
  of copying data one-by-one on each draw call from the days of immediate mode.
  We also get the power to copy the data before drawing starts.

Rendering wireframe:

  call:
  glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT, GL_LINE);
  Before rendering.

We don't have to store just 3d data in vertex buffers.
Common uses include; 2d texture, coordinates that describe how to fit an image
to a surface, and 3d normals that describe which way a surface is facing
so that we can calculate lighting.

Most objects will have 2 or 3 vertex buffers each.

Multiple VBOs for a VAO

  Must bind each VBO to the vao.
